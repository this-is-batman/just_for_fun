# Repositories for some random code snippets

This repository contains the code snippets, which I write for fun, when inspiration strikes, or when I am getting too bored. The structure is not too complicated, and mostly contains only script files in python. 

## Directory structure
* All the python scripts are present in the `/src/` directory.
* All the test functions , including the pytest modules are present in the `/tests` directory.


## For storing the nltk data
* All the nltk data is stored inside `~/home/user_name/nltk_data/`.
* Download the packages required using the following lines of code for nltk
```
import nltk
nltk.download({package_name}, download_dir = '~/home/user_name/nltk_data/')
```


**Future**: In future, or whenever I wish, I also wish to write some codes in C++ or in C, and store it in github for posterity.

**Disclaimer**: For now, this is meant to be a private repository. At any point in the future though, it may be made public according to my wishes.
